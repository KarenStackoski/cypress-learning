# cypress-learning
In this repository, you can see what I'm practicing about Cypress. There's some websites and API's that I've been testing to study more form Cypress.
- In *[testesFuncionais](https://github.com/KarenStackoski/cypress-learning/tree/main/cypress/e2e/testesFuncionais)*, you can see some tests I made with the app *[barrigaReact](https://barrigareact.wcaquino.me)*.
- In *[testesApi](https://github.com/KarenStackoski/cypress-learning/tree/main/cypress/e2e/testesApi)*, you can see some tests I made using an API called *[barrigaRest](https://barrigarest.wcaquino.me)*, the same API used in *barrigaReact*.
